# 🎁 Gift Finder – Product Brief

## Core Idea
A tool that lets someone send a playful, anonymous message asking what would make the recipient happy (birthday, new home, etc.), so they can gift something meaningful. The recipient doesn’t know who sent it.

## Flow
1. Sender logs in
2. Chooses occasion + message channel (email or WhatsApp)
3. Message preview shown
4. Recipient receives message & submits gift ideas
5. Sender gets a response + gift suggestions

## Style
- Tone: Fun, playful, bold (inspired by *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck*)
- Emojis, GIFs, gradients, confetti
- Mobile-first

## Priorities
- Not spammy
- No dashboard
- Simple user flow
